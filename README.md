# Nova-Financial-Solutions
This project is like a big puzzle where we want to figure out how news about companies affects their stock prices. 
What’s Given to Us:

We have a bunch of news articles that talk about different companies. Each article has a headline, the date it was published, and which company it’s about.
We also have stock prices for these companies. Stock prices go up and down every day, and we want to see if the news can help us predict these changes.
What We Need to Do:

Sentiment Analysis: We’ll look at the headlines to see if the news is positive, negative, or neutral. For example, if the headline says “Company A is doing great!”, it’s positive.
Correlation Analysis: After finding out if the news is good or bad, we’ll check if the stock price of the company went up or down after the news was published. This helps us understand if good news makes stock prices go up and bad news makes them go down.
The goal is to find patterns that can help us predict stock prices based on the news. This could be very useful for making smart investment decisions.

Steps to Take
Set Up Our Environment:

We need to create a workspace where all the code and data will be stored properly. 

We’ll start by understanding the data, running some basic analysis, and getting familiar with what’s inside.
Fetch Additional Data:

We’ll gather stock price data using a tool called yfinance. This will allow us to see how stock prices have changed over time.
Combine and Analyze:

We’ll put everything together to see if there’s a connection between the news and stock prices. This involves performing the sentiment analysis and checking for correlations.
Create a Report:

Finally, we’ll put together all our findings in a report.
